## Inspiration
**Classic MMO-RPG** is heavily inspires [OSRS](https://www.oldschool.runescape.com/); however, it doesn't right out steal unique features. As a child, we all spent numerous hours grinding OSRS; regardless, it was always the same, and no other game was quite like it, so out of pure nostalgia **classic mmo-rpg** was created.

The feel of **classic mmo-rpg** is designed to resemble ORRS; however, QOL *(Quality of life)* and modern features are implemented to make the game even more enjoyable and just as grindy


## Why Classic MMO-RPG
There are already modern games that resemble OSRC; for example, [Albion online](https://albiononline.com/en/home) uses low-poly high-res textures; however, it is polluted with pay-to-win features, and the code is propitiatory. 

Classic MMO-RPG doesn't have pay-to-win features and is entirely free to play. All technology and code are open-source and available for self-hosting; however, it does provide a community server list for everyone to connect to if they want to play with others.

## Look and feel
The style of **classic mmo-rpg** tries to trigger your nostalgia with low-poly assets, yet with high-res textures; as we said, this game is heavily inspired by the OSRS look.

## Lively feel with modern technology
We want to create a game that feels alive with ecosystems close to real life. A method to do this is to create artificial and procedural relationships between NPCs to give a lively feel to the game. This is called the [npc-relationship-engine](https://github.com/classicmmorpg/npc-relationship-engine), free and open-source for anyone to use.

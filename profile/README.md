## Inspiration
**Classic MMO-RPG** is heavily inspires [OSRS](https://www.oldschool.runescape.com/); however, it doesn't right out steal unique features. As a child, we all spent numerous hours grinding OSRS; regardless, it was always the same, and no other game was quite like it, so out of pure nostalgia **Classic MMO-RPG** was created.

The feel of classic mmo-rpg is designed to resemble ORRS; however, QOL *(Quality of life)* and modern features are implemented to make the game even more enjoyable and just as grindy
